          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I am a web developer with a background in mechanical engineering.
            <br/>
            My passion to build things with the purpose of solving problems sparked my curiosity to venture into software engineering.
            Through my self-teaching journey, I fell in love with web development.
          </p>
          <p>Coming from the automotive industry (Toyota/Tesla), I am eager to bring a new perspective and a root-cause analysis mindset for troubleshooting and building clean code.</p>
          <p>During my free time, I love playing PC co-op games, 3D printing and learning how to cook new recipes.</p>
